# Language_detector

In this project I use [European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/) which is a text dataset used for evaluating language detection engines. The 1.5GB corpus includes 21 languages spoken in EU. 

The Europarl parallel corpus is extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament. It includes versions in 21 European languages: Romanic (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian), Germanic (English, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish), Slavik (Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, Slovene), Finni-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian), and Greek.

All formats contain document $(<$CHAPTER id$>)$, speaker $(<$SPEAKER id name language$>)$, and paragraph $(<$P$>)$ mark-up on a separate line. The data is stored in one file per day, and in smaller units for newer data.
